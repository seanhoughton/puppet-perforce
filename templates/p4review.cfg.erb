####      CONFIGURATION VARIABLES: CHANGE AS NEEDED  ####
####                                                 ####

# The example section below shows all the values and their meaning. The
# actual section values start below the commented section.

# In particular, be sure to set/check the variables:
# administrator, mailhost and complain_from. 

# Section number. Copy the entire section of configuration variables foreach
# instance of Perforce and change the section number for each instance.
# [INSTANCE]

# administrator=admin@company.com
# Set this to the Perforce system administrator's
# email address. The <administrator> will be notified
# of problems with the script (e.g. invalid
# email addresses for users). If <bcc_admin> is set
# <administrator> will get a copy of all email the
# script generates.

# mailhost=mail.company.com
# The hostname of the machine running your local SMTP server.

# debug=0
# If <debug> is true then messages go to stdout
# and email is not actually sent to users. Instead,
# all messages go to <administrator>, or no email
# is sent at all if <administrator> = None. Setting
# <debug> to larger values creates more output.

# repeat=0
# Set to 1 to repeat every <sleeptime> seconds.
# Set to 0 to run just once - do this if running from cron.

# sleeptime=60
# Number of seconds to sleep between invocations
# Irrelevant if <repeat>, above, is 0.

# limit_emails=50
# Don't send more than this many emails of
# each type (job and change) at a time. This is
# a safety feature that prevents runaway email.

# notify_changes=1
# notify_jobs=0
# Set <notify_changes> to 0 to disable change notification completely.
# Set <notify_jobs>  to 0 to disable job notification completely.
# (Note that at least ONE of these should be set to true: otherwise
# there's no reason to ever run this program!)

# bcc_admin=0
# Set to 1 to Bcc: ALL email to the administrator

# send_to_author=0
# Set to 1 to CC: email to the original author of the changelist or job

# reply_to_admin=0
# Set to 1 to set the emails Reply-To: field to the administrator

# maildomain=None
# If value is None, the script will look up the email
# address for each Perforce user in the "p4 user"
# data via "p4 user -o <username>". If, instead,
# you set this variable <maildomain> to any domain
# (like "yourcompany.com") then the review daemon
# will assume that Perforce user <username> has
# the email address <username>@<maildomain>.

# jobpath=//depot/jobs
# Send job review mail to users reviewing <jobpath>.
# See "p4 help user" for more information.

# datefield=Date
# A job field used to determine which jobs users are notified
# of changes to. When the review daemon runs, subscribing users are
# notified of any jobs with a higher value in this field then the
# value in the "jobreview" counter -- and when job notification is
# completed, the "jobreview' counter is updated accordingly.
#
# This field needs to appear in your jobspec as a "date" field
# with persistence "always". See "p4 help jobspec" for more
# information.

# servername=DNS_server_name
# Used in the subject line for emails so people can tell which
# server the email came from.
