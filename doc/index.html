<h2 id="label-Module+Description">Module Description</h2>

<p>The Perforce module installs, configures, and manages the various Perforce
components.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: This module is currently under development. I thought I&#39;d release
it to the forge as it&#39;s progressed pretty well, but there are still
several things that are being modified.</p>

<p>Specifically: * Documentation – docs are a work in progress (aren&#39;t
they always??) * Tests – basic unit tests are in the <code>examples</code>
directory, but rspec tests are still forthcoming * Windows Support – still
needs some work so right now it&#39;s not enabled * Other Product Support –
later I want to expand this to Proxy (p4p), P4Web, etc. support but
initially I am focussed on p4, p4d, and p4broker</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the perforce module. It provides the ability to manage Perforce
client and server components, within an SDP (Server Deployment Package)
environment.</p>

<h2 id="label-Setup">Setup</h2>

<h3 id="label-Getting+Started+with+Perforce">Getting Started with Perforce</h3>

<h4 id="label-Perforce+Client">Perforce Client</h4>

<h5 id="label-Usage">Usage</h5>

<p>If you want the Perforce command-line client (p4) managed with the default
options you can declare</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">include &#39;::perforce::client</code></pre>

<p>If you need to customize options, such as the p4 version to manage or the
install location, you can pass in the attributes:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">class { &#39;::perforce::client&#39;:
  p4_version    =&gt; &#39;2016.2&#39;,
  install_dir   =&gt; &#39;/usr/local/bin&#39;,
}</code></pre>

<p>When installing in an SDP (Server Deployment Package) environment, ensure
that the <code>perforce::sdp_base</code> class is declared. If declared,
then the client software will be installed in the /p4/common/bin directory
and the associated version and symbolic links will be created. When
installing in an SDP environment, do not specify the install_dir attribute,
as the install location should be controlled by the SDP installation.</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">include ::perforce::sdp_base
include ::perforce::client</code></pre>

<h4 id="label-Perforce+Server">Perforce Server</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: This class is used to manage the p4d binaries on the node, but it
does not manage an instance. Instances can be managed using the defined
type <code>perforce::instance</code>, but this type does require that the
SDP is also being managed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="label-Usage">Usage</h5>

<p>If you want the Perforce service (p4d) managed with the default options you
can declare</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_include'>include</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>::perforce::server</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span>
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to customize options, such as the p4d version to manage or the
install location, you can pass in the attributes:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">class { &#39;::perforce::server&#39;:
  p4d_version   =&gt; &#39;2016.2&#39;,
  install_dir   =&gt; &#39;/usr/local/bin&#39;,
}</code></pre>

<p>When installing in an SDP (Server Deployment Package) environment, ensure
that the <code>perforce::sdp_base</code> class is declared. If declared,
then the software will be installed in the /p4/common/bin directory and the
associated version and symbolic links will be created. When installing in
an SDP environment, do not specify the install_dir attribute, as the
install location should be controlled by the SDP installation.</p>

<p>The SDP requires that a Perforce client also be present, so typically the
<code>perforce::client</code> class should also be declared</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">include ::perforce::sdp_base
include ::perforce::client
include ::perforce::server</code></pre>

<h4 id="label-Perforce+Broker">Perforce Broker</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: This class is used to manage the p4broker binaries on the node, but
it does not manage an instance. Instances can be managed using the defined
type <code>perforce::instance</code>, but this type does require that the
SDP is also being managed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="label-Usage">Usage</h5>

<p>If you want the Perforce broker service (p4broker) managed with the default
options you can declare</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_include'>include</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>::perforce::broker</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span>
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to customize options, such as the p4broker version to manage or
the install location, you can pass in the attributes:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">class { &#39;::perforce::broker&#39;:
  p4broker_version =&gt; &#39;2016.2&#39;,
  install_dir      =&gt; &#39;/usr/local/bin&#39;,
}</code></pre>

<p>When installing in an SDP (Server Deployment Package) environment, ensure
that the <code>perforce::sdp_base</code> class is declared. If declared,
then the software will be installed in the /p4/common/bin directory and the
associated version and symbolic links will be created. When installing in
an SDP environment, do not specify the install_dir attribute, as the
install location should be controlled by the SDP installation.</p>

<p>The SDP requires that a Perforce client also be present, so typically the
<code>perforce::client</code> class should also be declared</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">include ::perforce::sdp_base
include ::perforce::client
include ::perforce::broker</code></pre>

<h3 id="label-Server+Deployment+Package">Server Deployment Package</h3>

<p>The Perforce SDP provides a sample implementation of best practices, such
as performing offline checkpoints, rotating logs and journals routinely,
and doing a database sanity/safety check before starting the server. It is
open source and available at <a
href="https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/projects/perforce-software-sdp">swarm.workshop.perforce.com/projects/perforce-software-sdp</a></p>

<h4 id="label-SDP+Commmon+Files">SDP Commmon Files</h4>

<h5 id="label-Usage">Usage</h5>

<p>The <code>perforce::sdp_base</code> class manages the base SDP
installation. To declare this class and accept the default attribute
values, you can use</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='id identifier rubyid_include'>include</span> <span class='tstring'><span class='tstring_beg'>&#39;</span><span class='tstring_content'>::perforce::sdp_base</span><span class='tstring_end'>&#39;</span></span>
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to customize options, such as the OS user to manage or the
install location, you can pass in the attributes:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">class { &#39;::perforce::sdp_base&#39;:
  osuser =&gt; &#39;perforce&#39;,
  osgroup =&gt; &#39;perforce&#39;,
  p4_dir =&gt; &#39;/p4&#39;,
}</code></pre>

<h4 id="label-Managing+Instances">Managing Instances</h4>

<h5 id="label-Usage">Usage</h5>

<p>Instances can only be managed within the context of an existing
<code>perforce::sdp_base</code> installation. Managed instances can be
server, broker, or both.</p>

<p>The <code>perforce::instance</code> defined type requires that</p>

<p>For example, to create a p4d instance called &#39;1&#39; with the server_id
&#39;master&#39;, declare the following:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">include ::perforce::sdp_base
include ::perforce::client
include ::perforce::server

::perforce::instance {&#39;1&#39;:
  server_id    =&gt; &#39;master&#39;,
  ensure       =&gt; &#39;running&#39;,
  p4port       =&gt; &#39;1666&#39;,
}</code></pre>
